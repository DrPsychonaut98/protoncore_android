    <!-- On Android API up to 27 the RippleDrawable halves the color alpha.
         mtrl_low_ripple_*_alpha and mtrl_high_ripple_*_alpha are defined to work around this
         and are used throughout the Material Components library.
         There is one exception: TabLayout that uses RippleUtils.convertToRippleDrawableColor and
         multiplies alpha by 2, also on API28+ leading to ripples that are too dark.

         ripple_tab_alpha is defined to work around this.
